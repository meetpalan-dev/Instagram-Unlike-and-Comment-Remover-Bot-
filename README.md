# Instagram Activity Cleaner

A lightweight browser-based JavaScript tool to extract and manage Instagram activity such as liked posts and comments.

This script runs directly in the browser console and helps export approved media filenames into a CSV file.

## 🚀 Features
- Auto-scrolls and clicks Instagram activity items
- Extracts media filenames
- Exports results as a CSV file
- No login credentials required
- No external libraries

## 🧠 How It Works
The script interacts with Instagram’s DOM elements, simulating user actions like scrolling and clicking, then extracts visible metadata.

## 📌 Usage
1. Open Instagram in your browser
2. Navigate to **Settings → Your Activity**
3. Open **Likes** or **Comments**
4. Open Developer Tools → Console
5. Paste the script and press Enter

A CSV file will download automatically.
